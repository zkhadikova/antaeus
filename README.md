## Antaeus

Antaeus (/ænˈtiːəs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.

## Description

A service is used to schedule payment of invoices on the first of the month.

## Developing

Requirements:
- \>= Java 11 environment

### Building

```
./gradlew build
```

### Running

There are 2 options for running Anteus. You either need libsqlite3 or docker. Docker is easier but requires some docker knowledge. We do recommend docker though.


*Running through docker*

Install docker for your platform

```
make docker-run
```

*Running Natively*

Native java with sqlite (requires libsqlite3):

If you use homebrew on MacOS `brew install sqlite`.

```
./gradlew run
```

### App Structure
The code given is structured as follows.
```
├── pleo-antaeus-app
|       main() & initialization
|
├── pleo-antaeus-core
|       Contains payment processing.
|       Contains scheduling.
|
├── pleo-antaeus-data
|       Module interfacing with the database. Contains the database models, mappings and access layer.
|
├── pleo-antaeus-models
|       Definition of the "rest api" models used throughout the application.
|
├── pleo-antaeus-rest
|        Entry point for REST API. This is where the routes are defined.
└──
```

### Key design points
1 Use Quartz Scheduler to create cron jobs

2 Mock external payment system: 

* check if customer exists using local REST API 
* return random value as account balance 

3 Add transaction log for invoice processing
